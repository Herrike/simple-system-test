# GitHub User Search App (Simple-System Test)

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
This is my GitHub User Search app.
This is a React + TypeScript + SWR project where you can search for GitHub users and check out their repositories.

## What Does It Do?

- **Search Users:** Type in a username, and itâ€™ll show you up to 5 matching GitHub users.
- **View Repos:** Click on a user, and youâ€™ll see all their public repositories (no limits!).
- **Mobile-Friendly:** Works great on both your desktop and your phone. ðŸ“±ðŸ’»
- **UI:** Built with Material-UI to make things look polished.

## Built With

Hereâ€™s the tech powering the app:

- **React:** For all the reactive UI magic
- **TypeScript:** To keep things clean and error-free.
- **Vite:** For a super-fast development experience.
- **SWR:** Handles data fetching, with caching and revalidation.
- **Jotai:** Lightweight state management.
- **Material-UI:** For beautiful components and icons.
- **Octokit:** To talk to the GitHub API.
- **Lefthook:** Quality check - in this case - script runner.
- **Vitest** Unit+Integration test suite.
